Stuff to add -

- I want to display the total time a user has worked that day
- my stats page should have:
  - total time worked that day
  - total time worked each day that week
  - total time worke all time
  - number of pomodoro's they've completed that day
  - pomodoro's all time
  - pomodoro's each day that week
- I want to implement a login system so that users can track their stats over sessions and throughout the day
